# Budget-Tracker

Using starter code provided by the U of M Bootcamp, I created an budget tracking application which can be used online or offline. Offline the app uses IndexedDB to store transactions until an internet connection is reached and the application is back online, at which point the transactions are recorded and stored in the app's MongoDB database.
